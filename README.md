Objects.
If a class is the blueprint, then an object is an instance (or implementation) of that blueprint. Try to create multiple instances of a class, define and set internal state, and declare static constructors that better reflect how you might speak in real life.

Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to inherit the traits and behavior of another class. This should instantly make sense, in the same way that a child inherits characteristics from their parents. 

Abstract Classes.
An abstract class provides a template - or base - for any subclasses. I have work through an example that demonstrates an instance of how, why, and when you might reach for an abstract class.

Handshakes and Interfaces.
Think of an interface as a class with no behavior. Instead, it describes the terms for a particular contract. Any class that signs this contract must adhere to those terms.
